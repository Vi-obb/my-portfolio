          But you already knew that. This is where I tell you about myself. I'm a mathematician,
          software engineer, and designer. I'm passionate about building products that are simple,
            intuitive, and delightful to use. I'm also passionate about learning and teaching. I
            am currently a teaching assistant at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, 
            teaching the basics of programming and numerical analysis.
