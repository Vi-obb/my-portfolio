There’s this surreal feeling that comes with having your portfolio website. Especially when you’ve put a lot of time and effort into it. _It’s like you own a piece of the internet_.

I’ve been dragging my feet about building my portfolio site. Heaven knows the number of `my-portfolio-site` repos I have on [Github](https://github.com/Vi-obb) (don’t check, I deleted them all). Then there was a time I considered using no-code website builders because I was generally sick of coding websites (I mean who wants to write code when you can drag and drop rectangles). Then I found Astro…

## Love at first site?

Found out about [Astro](https://astro.build/) in 2022 (I think). I saved [Traversy Media’s](https://youtu.be/Oi9z5gfIHJs?si=3CI6hBToYLLnRid4) youtube video on Astro, that I was going to watch and learn more about it — I never did. Fast forward 2024, Astro popped up on my X timeline. Then I decided to revisit Astro, this time straight to the docs. I followed their tutorial on building a blog site, and it just occurred to me to build my portfolio site with Astro. The content collections feature was just what I needed.

## Inspiration

For the first time I set out straight to code, no designs whatsoever. I knew if I took time to design before I built, the chances of me finishing were almost nonexistent (happened so many times). I made some sketches though, of how I wanted my `project cards` to be displayed.

As I went along, I visited the websites of some of my favorite designers where I picked some ideas for how I wanted my portfolio site to turn out. Below are the links to their sites:

- [Dann Petty](https://www.dannpetty.com/)

- [Pedro Duarte](https://ped.ro/)

- James [(Wireframe)](https://www.wireframe.co/)

I also got some inspiration from:

- [Notgr](https://degreat.co.uk/)

- [Erika](https://erika.florist/)

- [Eva](https://eva.town/)

### Got more coming

I’m not done yet. I have a lot of ideas for my portfolio site. I’m going to keep adding more projects and blog posts. I’m excited about the journey ahead. Will keep you updated!
